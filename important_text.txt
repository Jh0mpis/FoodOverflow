Love in a thousand different flavors
I wish that I could taste them all tonight (yeah)
No, I ain't got no dinner plans
So you should bring all your friends
I swear that-a-all y'all my type

All you gyals in here
If you're feelin' thirsty
Come on, take a sip
'Cause you know what I'm servin', uh

Shimmy, shimmy yay, shimmy yay, shimmy ya
(Drank) swalla-la-la
(Drank) swalla-la-la
(Swalla-la-la) swalla-la-la
Shimmy, shimmy yay, shimmy yay, shimmy ya
(Drank) swalla-la-la
(Drank) swalla-la-la
(Swalla-la-la) swalla-la-la

Freaky, freaky gyal
My freaky, freaky gyal

Shimmy, shimmy, shimmy yay, shimmy yah
Bad girls gon' swalla-la-la
Bust down on my wrist in this bitch
My pinky ring bigger than his
Met her out in Beverly Hills, ayy
Dolla got too many girls, ayy
Met her out in Beverly Hills
All she wear is red bottom heels
When she back it up, put it on the Snap
When she droppin' low, put it on the Gram
DJ poppin', she gon' swallow that
Champagne poppin', she gon' swallow that

All you gyals in here
If you're feelin' thirsty
Come on, take a sip
'Cause you know what I'm servin', uh

Shimmy, shimmy yay, shimmy yay, shimmy ya
(Drank) swalla-la-la

(Swalla-la-la) swalla-la-la

Freaky, freaky gyal
My freaky, freaky gyal (yo, yo)

Ayo, bad gyal no swalla nuttin', word to the Dalai Lama
He know I'm a fashion killa, word to John Galliano
He coppin' that Valentino
Ain't no telling me no
I'm that bitch and he know, he know

How y'all wifin' these thots? You don't get wins for that
I'm havin' another good year, we don't get blimps for that
Pussy game still cold, we don't get minks for that
When I'm poppin' them bananas, we don't link chimps for that
I gave these bitches two years, now your time's up
Bless her heart, she throwin' shots, but every line sucks
I'm in that cherry red foreign with the brown guts
My shit slappin' like dude did LeBron's nuts

All you gyals in here
If you're feeling thirsty
Come on, take a sip
'Cause you know what I'm servin' (ahn), uh

Shimmy, shimmy yay, shimmy yay, shimmy ya (my love)
(Drank) swalla-la-la (my love)
(Drank) swalla-la-la (my love)
(Swalla-la-la) swalla-la-la
Shimmy, shimmy yay, shimmy yay, shimmy ya
(Drank) swalla-la-la
(Drank) swalla-la-la
(Swalla-la-la) swalla-la-la
